            <p>Hi, Anthony Eglon here. I'm hoping you enjoy looking through my website and the artworks I have made to date. I was born and raised in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, where I attended both my Foundation Degree Year (Newcastle College) and achieved my First Class BFA Degree at Northumbria University. After Finishing my degree at Northumbria University, I was accepted for the role of Sculpture Fellow at the same institue, allowing me to continue my practice as well as helping undergraduates develop their work via workshops.</p>

        <h3>My Work</h3>
        <p>The main themes of my work revolve around my views of my own masculinity as well as my eternal inner struggle of wanting to break gallery rules and touch every texture in sight. My practice evolved down two routes, wall sculptures and floor sculptures. As previously stated both involve the bigger themes of masculinity and wanting to be touched or interacted with.</p>
        <p> I use the same blueprint for all my floor sculptures in which a skeleton is constructed which is influenced by the shapes of post 20th sculptures. With a shape in mind I usually try to make the sculptures as close to male proportions as possible, especially height wise. The sculptures are then made with a material that I find tactile wise intriguing and pleasing to try and entice the viewer to break those pesky gallery rules and get a bit more acquainted with the sculptures.</p> 
        <p>The floor sculptures also serve another purpose and that is to act as fellow gallery viewer in an exhibition, these sculptures are purposely set to face other art works, being my own or others, to create a conversation between the pieces and try to introduce the viewer into having a three way conversation. To further humanise the sculptures I give them names based on the artists works that they are based on.</p>
        <p>On to the wall sculptures, these are created to have a comment on masculinity and the idea of if a male doesn’t fit into the typical idea of “being a man” does he lose value in himself. This is shown via how I take objects/tools associated with masculinity and make them defunct by taking away their primary purpose and attempt to show them in a different light via exhibiting. Through defuncting objects I came to notice just how phallic all these objects were so decided to start producing them with silicon, due to the materials’.... floppiness.</p>
